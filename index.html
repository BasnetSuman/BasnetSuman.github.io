        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>
            I am a Research Fellow at the Clean Energy Research Platform (CERP),
            King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), where I work
            on high-pressure combustion, CFD, and scientific machine learning.
        </p>

        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p>
            My work focuses on turbulent combustion, high-fidelity numerical simulation,
            and the integration of data-driven modeling for predictive flow analysis.
            I am particularly interested in applying physics-informed machine learning
            to model reacting flows in propulsion and energy systems.
        </p>

        <h2>Short Bio</h2>
        <p>
            Before joining KAUST, I earned my MSc in Space and Astronautical Engineering
            from Sapienza University of Rome and a B.Tech in Aerospace Engineering from India.
            My long-term goal is to pursue an academic career in mechanical and aerospace
            engineering, advancing the understanding of complex reactive flow systems.
